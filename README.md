# Bank_optimization

# The main aim of the project to distribute the money of the bank into different classes like vehicle loan,..... in such a way that they obtain maximum profit.

  In this project there are two phases 
      
        1> Phase 1 : The total amount of the bank is being distributed into four classes (vehicle,credit_card,personal,home) 
                      This phase is implemented using Genetic Algorithm.
                      I have used genetic algo nsga-2 for multi objective optimizartion
                      
                      Multi Objective Optimization: 
                          In this I am using two cost functions one is the profit which is to be maximized and the other is to reduce risk.
       2> Phase 2: In this phase the applications for loans are taken into consideration and classified as good or bad loan .
                   By reducing the bad loans we can reduce the losses to the bank.
